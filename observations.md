**Observation 1:** Concept of response spectrum <br>

There are 3 buildings shown on the screen. User can select mass and stiffness of all 3 buildings. However, user need to make sure that at least two buildings time period is same.<br>
Select the earthquake ground motion record and also damping.<br>
Run the experiment.<br>
You will observe after completing that the maximum displacement of the oscillators with same time period is same irrespective of their different masses and stiffnesses. <br>
