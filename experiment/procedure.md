**Observation 1:** Concept of Response Spectrum

- There are 2 buildings shown on the screen. User can select the mass and stiffness of both the buildings. However, user needs to make sure that both buildings have the same time period, i.e, the ratio of mass and stiffness is the same.   
- Select the earthquake ground motion dataset to be used. Note that it is recommended to use the default of 1 for best understanding.
- It will be observed that the maximum displacements(values can be seen in the graphs) of both the oscillators are the same irrespective of their different mass and stiffness values given that their time periods are the same. 

**Observation 2:** Construction of Response Spectrum

- Select the time period of the building as per your choice. The range of time periods that can be used is from 0.1 sec up to 4.0 secs in increments of 0.1 sec.
- After selecting the time period, user can select the earthquake ground motion record of their choice. Note that it is recommended to use the default of 1 for best understanding. User can also set the damping(etta).
- User can find the maximum response corresponding to the time period selected highlighted in the graphs by a red point.
- User may repeat the experiment using different ground records and damping values to observe corresponding changes in the graphs. 
- Note that there is no simulation or animation for this observation. Only a static diagram has been displayed for a basic understanding.

**Video:** Realistic Simulation

- The video enables the user to gain a deeper insight and hence a better understanding by observing the experiment being simulated in a live environment with appropriate lab equipment.

**Graphs:**

- There are various features available for the graphs such as zoom, etc. The function/feature of each icon above the graphs becomes visible upon hovering over the concerned icon.
