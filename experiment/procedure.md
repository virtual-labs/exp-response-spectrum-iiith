**Observation 1:**

- Concept of response spectrum
- There are 3 buildings shown on the screen. User can select mass and stiffness of all 3 buildings. However, user need to make sure that at least two buildings time period is same.
- Select the earthquake ground motion record and also damping.
- Run the experiment.
- You will observe after completing that the maximum displacement of the oscillators with same time period is same irrespective of their different masses and stiffnesses.
